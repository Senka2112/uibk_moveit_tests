TODO: Extend package documentation!!!

Visualize IK test results
=========================

Move into the 'results' folder of this project. It contains the generated files of the test run

  roscd uibk_moveit_tests/results
  
Launch RViz as the results are displayed as markers

  roslaunch uibk_moveit_tests ik_test.launch
  
Start the tool that evaluates the test result file and publishes the marker message to RViz

  rosrun uibk_moveit_tests visualize_ik_resul results_left

or

  rosrun uibk_moveit_tests visualize_ik_resul results_right
  
Now you should be able to see the visualization in RViz. Black cubes mean the position was not reachable at all.
The color range from red to green indicates, for how many orientations a valid IK solution could be found for each point.
The file with the sample poses contains 3500 points with 17 poses per point but it can easily be extended.

TODO: Explain the other tools within this package!!!
